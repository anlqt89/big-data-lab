## 🛠️ Big Data & Technical Skills

This project serves as a "lab" for implementing several core big data and engineering principles:

* **Efficient Data Fetching:** Implements optimized API integration to handle large volumes of movie metadata in real-time.
* **State Management & Scalability:** Built with **React** and **Vite** to ensure a fast, responsive UI even when filtering through thousands of data points.
* **Data Visualization:** (If applicable, e.g., "Uses D3.js/Chart.js to visualize genre distribution over time").
* **Performance Optimization:** Utilizes lazy loading and asset optimization (SVG) to maintain high Lighthouse scores and low latency.
